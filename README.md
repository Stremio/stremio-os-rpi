# Stremio OS for Raspberry Pi

This repo has builds of the Stremio OS for RPI5 and RPI4 which can be found [under releases](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-os-rpi/releases).

The image is based on a custom build of [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) v21 (Android TV 14) made by [Konstakang](https://konstakang.com/).

The only changes made to the custom image are:
- Stremio boot animation
- included [Aptoide TV](https://en.aptoide.com/) (to handle auto-updates of apps)
- included [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/downloads) app (for Android TV)
- included "Stremio Launch on Boot" app (can be used to make the Stremio app start on boot)

**The image does not include any Google services or apps.**

For a guide on how to install and use Stremio OS for RPI, you can read [this blog post](https://blog.stremio.com/stremio-os-is-now-available-for-raspberry-pi-5-4/).
